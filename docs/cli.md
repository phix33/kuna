# The `kuna` CLI reference

The user-facing commands are the single Rust binary `kuna`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli`, built to `decompiler/target/release/kuna` by
`make binaries`). This is the full reference; the one-screen version is in
`docs/agents.md`.

All command output goes through a fallible stdout boundary. A downstream reader that closes
the pipe early is a normal terminal condition, not the `println!` panic (exit `101`) it used
to be: no panic text, no broken-pipe diagnostic. It suppresses the *diagnostic*, not the
*verdict* — the command still exits with the code its own work earned, so `kuna test | head`
on a regressed baseline exits `1` and the DIV-45 failure contract below holds with or without
a reader. Other stdout write failures are real errors: reported, and exit `1`.

An ELF whose **section table is unusable** is loaded anyway, from its program headers.
A corrupt `e_shoff`/`e_shnum`/`e_shstrndx` used to reject the whole file — every
command exited `1` with `not in recognized object file format: Invalid ELF section
header offset/size/alignment` on an image `readelf -l` reads happily. The section
table is link-time metadata; the entry point and the `PT_LOAD` map are not, so it is
dropped and the run continues, printing one line on stderr naming what was dropped
and what survived:

```
$ kuna functions ./sstripped --json
[kuna] ELF section table unusable (57007 section headers at e_shoff 0xdead run
2176129 bytes past the end of a 161156-byte file); continuing from the program
headers (entry 0x80492d0, 2 load segment(s))
```

Discovery then works from the executable `PT_LOAD` segments, so `functions`,
`decompile-all`, `disassemble` and `strings` all answer (`strings` reports
`"scanned": "segments"`). A UPX-packed image is left alone: it is section-less too,
but its load segments are a decompressor stub, and the zero-discovery diagnostic
pointing at `kuna unpack` is the more useful answer.

## `kuna test` — the parity gates

```bash
kuna test --all --baseline docs/baseline.json          # expect: PARITY OK
kuna test --datatests --json                           # machine-readable
kuna test --datatests --datatests-dir tests/stages \
    --baseline docs/baseline-stages.json               # the stage-issue corpus (= make test-stages)
```

`kuna test` parses the harness's two streams separately (unit results on **stderr**,
datatest results on **stdout**) and exits nonzero on any failure or baseline regression.
`--save-baseline PATH` re-records a baseline. Routine use: `docs/baseline-stages.json`
when adding stage tests. `docs/baseline.json` is re-pinned only for sanctioned intentional
changes (an upstream sync per `docs/history.md`, a DIV-recorded default flip) — never to
absorb a regression.

## `kuna decompile` — one function

```bash
kuna decompile ./a.out main
kuna decompile ./stripped.bin 0x401040 --addr
kuna decompile ./a.out main --option compareform canonical
kuna decompile ./sparc.elf main --option returnpair single
kuna decompile ./a.out main --language rust
```

Drives `decomp_dbg` as a subprocess and captures `print C` via `openfile write`, so
interactive prompts never pollute the output. `--option NAME VALUE` (repeatable) and
`--kassert "<args>"` flip phase-model sub-phase assertions per run; `--mode
auto|reliable|aggressive|fast` applies an option preset (`docs/modes.md`).

**The instruction budget.** Flow following decodes at most `maxinstruction`
instructions per function — 100000 by default, which no ordinary function comes
near and an obfuscated one blows through. Past the budget the decompiling
surfaces **truncate** the flow and emit the body they did decode, under a
warning header that says so:

```bash
# a 1.8M-instruction MBA-obfuscated checker: a truncated body, not a failure
kuna decompile-all ./crackme.exe --functions sub_140001000 --json
#   "code": "unsigned int sub_140001000(...)  // warn: Exceeded the 100000
#            instruction budget: some flow is truncated ..."

# ask for more of it (the cost is roughly linear, in time and in memory)
kuna decompile-all ./crackme.exe --functions sub_140001000 --option maxinstruction 400000 --json

# or make the overrun fatal again, which is upstream's policy and the engine default
kuna decompile ./crackme.exe main --option errortoomanyinstructions on
#   error: Flow exceeded maximum allowable instructions
```

Both options are upstream `OptionDatabase` names rather than phase-model ones, so
they are reachable through `--option` on every surface but do not appear in `kuna
catalog`. `--max-fn-seconds` (see `decompile-all` below) is the wall-clock half of
the same budget.

**`--define-function <start[-end][=name] | @file>`** (repeatable) tells kuna where a
function starts and ends. Every boundary kuna knows is otherwise *derived* —
discovery finds the entries, and the extent is the address-contiguous clip to the
next one over an unbounded flow follow — which is the wrong answer on exactly the
images where reverse engineering is hard. A missed entry merges two functions into
one; a phantom one invents a function that is not there.

```bash
# an entry discovery missed: name it and decompile it
kuna decompile ./packed.bin 0x4014a0 --addr --define-function 0x4014a0=stage2

# two functions merged into one: say where the first really ends
kuna decompile ./packed.bin --addr 0x4013c9 --define-function 0x4013c9-0x401420=stage1

# keep the boundaries you worked out, and pass them to every later command
cat > bounds.txt <<'EOF'
# recovered by hand from the unpacked image
0x4013c9-0x401420 = stage1
0x401420-0x401500 = stage2
EOF
kuna functions ./packed.bin --json --define-function @bounds.txt
```

`start` declares the entry: it gets a function symbol (so call sites name it), it
enumerates in `kuna functions`, and it resolves by name. `end` is **exclusive** and
declares the extent: flow following stops there, so the body no longer swallows its
neighbours, and the extent reported by `kuna functions --json` is the declared one
rather than the clip. `=name` is optional and names the entry (an entry the image
already named keeps its name unless you supply one); `end` is optional too — a bare
`--define-function 0x4014a0` asserts an entry and leaves the extent natural.
Addresses are hexadecimal with or without `0x`.

A declared `end` that cuts real control flow is reported rather than silently
truncating the body: the function carries a `// warn: Function flows out of bounds`
comment on its prototype and one at each cut edge, naming the address the edge left
for. That holds for a conditional branch over the end as much as for fall-through
past it — including a branch to the exclusive end itself, which is what a
tail-clipped `if (err) goto fail;` looks like. A correct boundary ends in a return
and produces no warning, so that comment is the signal to widen the range.

The `@file` form is the durable one: one declaration per line, `#` comments and
blank lines skipped. kuna does not write boundaries back into the image, so the file
is the artifact — generate it, diff it, and pass it to every invocation. The flag is
accepted by `decompile`, `decompile-all`, `functions`, `decompile-project` and
`disassemble`; a declaration is applied after analysis has had its say, so it
overrides discovery rather than competing with it. The console spelling, for a
hand-driven `decomp_dbg` session, is `function bounds <start> [<end>] [as <name>]`.

**`--assert <directive> | @file`** (repeatable) is the other half: where
`--define-function` tells kuna where a function *is*, `--assert` tells it what
anything *is*. Everything kuna knows it derived, and until this flag the only
levers the `kuna` binary offered were `--option` and `--kassert` — the console has
carried `rename`, `retype`, `map param`, `map return`, `map address`,
`comment instruction` and `parse line extern` all along, unreachable.

```bash
kuna decompile ./a.out authenticate --json \
  --assert 'prototype authenticate int authenticate(char *user,char *pass)' \
  --assert 'type v2 char[16]' \
  --assert 'name v2 credbuf'
```

```text
- unsigned long authenticate(char *a0,char *a1)     - char v2 [8];
+ int authenticate(char *user,char *pass)           + char credbuf [16];
```

One directive per `--assert`, keyed by intent rather than by phase:

| directive | what it states |
|---|---|
| `prototype <func> <C declaration>` | the function's signature (parameter names included) |
| `param [<func>::]<i> <storage> <C typedecl>` | the storage and type of one input |
| `return [<func>::]<storage> <C typedecl>` | the storage and type of the return value |
| `name [<func>::]<symbol> <newname>` | rename a local |
| `type [<func>::]<symbol> <C type>` | retype a local |
| `typedef <C declaration>` | intern a `struct`/`union`/`enum`/`typedef` so `type` can name it |
| `data <addr> <C typedeclaration>` | a named, typed global at an address |
| `comment [<func>::]<addr> <text>` | a comment rendered into the C at that instruction |
| `flow [<func>::]<addr> branch\|call\|callreturn\|return` | the flow out of this instruction is not what kuna decided |
| `function <start>[-<end>][=<name>]` | the `--define-function` spelling, on this plane |
| `readonly <addr>+<size>` | the bytes in this range never change at run time |
| `volatile <addr>+<size>` | device memory: every access is a real access |

Storage is a register name (`RDI`), the console's `%RDI`, or its address grammar
(`[stack,-0x18,8]`). Addresses are hexadecimal with or without `0x`. A size is
decimal unless it carries a `0x`, and `<addr> <size>` is accepted wherever
`<addr>+<size>` is. A C type may be anything the console's `parse line` accepts,
including a `typedef` you asserted earlier in the same run.

**Write the type in C.** The standard scalar keywords — `void`, `char`, `short`,
`int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `signed`, `unsigned`, `_Bool`, `wchar_t` — are
accepted in any legal combination, in return position, in parameter position and
as a `type`/`param`/`return`/`data` operand, so a declaration kuna emitted can be
pasted straight back at it:

```bash
kuna decompile ./a.out sub_140004dcc --json \
  --assert 'prototype VirtualAlloc void *VirtualAlloc(void *p,unsigned int n,unsigned int a,unsigned int b)'
```

Widths come from the target's own compiler spec, so `long` is eight bytes on LP64
and four on LLP64. Ghidra's sized spellings (`int4`, `uint8`, `float8`,
`undefined`) still work and take precedence for a name the type factory already
knows. A combination that is not a C type (`short long`, `float int`) is rejected
by name.

**The two range directives are for memory kuna cannot classify by itself**, which
on a hostile or embedded image is most of it. `--option readonly on|off` is a
program-wide switch, not a range, and the loader's own read-only markup stops at
what the section flags say:

```bash
# `.data` is writable, so the loader never calls it read-only -- but nothing in
# this program writes these eight bytes, and the agent has checked.
kuna decompile ./fw.elf sample --assert 'readonly 0x404028+8'
#   - return scale * a0 + bias;
#   + return a0 * 7 + 100;

# 0x50000000 is a device register. Two reads of it are two reads; without this
# they are two loads of one unwritten address and CSE merges them.
kuna decompile ./fw.elf sample --assert 'volatile 0x50000000+4'
#   - return dat_50000000 * 2;
#   + v1 = dat_50000000; return v1 + dat_50000000;
```

Asserting a `readonly` range turns read-only propagation on for the run, because
painting a range read-only and then not folding it would be a directive that is
accepted and does nothing. It is applied *before* your own `--option`s, so an
explicit `--option readonly off` still wins.

**`flow` is the structuring lever**, and the one directive that changes which
bytes are even *in* the function. kuna decides at P2 whether an instruction
branches, calls, calls-and-does-not-return, or returns; on an obfuscated or
hand-written image it gets that wrong, and everything downstream inherits the
mistake. Stating the right answer costs one line:

```bash
# `sub_13c9` reaches an indirect `call *%rdx` that never comes back, so flow
# walks on into its twenty-four neighbours and the body is 25 dead temporaries.
kuna decompile ./a.out --addr 0x13c9 --json --assert 'flow 0x1405 return'
#   - v2 = (**(void **)(...))(dat_4014); v3 = sub_1129(v1); ... return v2 + v3 + ...;
#   + return dat_4014;
```

The four words are the console's own (`Override::stringToType`): `branch` reads
the instruction as a jump — which is what puts an indirect call back through
switch-table recovery — `call` as a call, `callreturn` as a call whose
fall-through is dead (the "does not return" case), and `return` as the end of the
function. A type the engine cannot apply at that instruction (`call` on an
indirect call has no destination to make direct) is not silently dropped: the
run reports the engine's own refusal as a per-function error.

**Every directive's fate is reported.** `--json` grows an `assertions` array — one
row per directive, in the order you gave them, carrying the directive text, its
phase and sub-phase, `applied` or `rejected`, and a reason:

```json
{"directive": "name v9 credbuf", "kind": "name", "phase": "P9",
 "subphase": "naming-policy", "status": "rejected",
 "detail": "No symbol named: v9"}
```

A rejection is also printed on stderr, on both surfaces. It is **not** fatal by
default — a batch of forty renames against a re-decompiled binary must not lose the
other thirty-nine to one stale name — and `--assert-strict` makes any rejection
exit non-zero.

**Order matters, and so does scoping.** Directives are applied in the order given:
`type v2 char[16]` then `name v2 credbuf` retypes and then renames, where the
reverse leaves the second naming a symbol the first renamed away. `name` and
`type` name a *local*, which does not exist until the function has been decompiled
once, so kuna decompiles it twice — but only when such a directive is present, so
nothing else pays for it. A directive that names no function binds to the function
being decompiled; on a run that decompiles more than one (`decompile-all`,
`decompile-project`) it is rejected rather than applied to every function that
happens to have a `v2`, so qualify it:

```bash
kuna decompile-all ./a.out --json --assert 'name authenticate::v2 credbuf'
```

A range property is painted before the image's symbols are mapped, because
mapping a symbol folds the property into it and never consults the range again —
so a range you state is honoured even where the loader already gave the address a
name. There is deliberately **no** `global` directive: `global add` is the console
command that would carry it, and every stock cspec's `<global>` already claims the
whole default data space (`<range space="ram"/>`), so on any ordinary image the
range is global before you say anything. `global add`/`global remove` are wired
and usable from `decomp_dbg` (the removal direction is the one that moves the C),
but a directive that is accepted and inert has no place on this plane.

The `@file` form is the durable one, exactly as for `--define-function`: one
directive per line, `#` comments and blank lines skipped, and the file is the
artifact — kuna does not write assertions back into the image.

```bash
cat > overrides.kuna <<'EOF'
# worked out from the strings and the xrefs
prototype sub_401200 int check_license(char *key,int len)
name sub_401200::v3 keylen
type sub_401200::v2 char[32]
data 0x601048 char *expected_key
flow sub_401200::0x40123f return   # the dispatch tail never comes back
readonly 0x601050+16   # the key table, written only by the installer
volatile 0x40021000+4  # RCC->CR
EOF
kuna decompile ./a.out sub_401200 --json --assert @overrides.kuna
```

Accepted by `decompile`, `decompile-all`, `decompile-project` and `functions`.
The console spellings, for a hand-driven `decomp_dbg` session, are the commands in
the table's second column.

**Paths containing spaces work (DIV-100).** This is the one surface that reaches the engine
through a console *script* rather than an in-process call, and the console reads a
filename with `s >> filename` — whitespace-delimited. An unquoted path with a space
therefore split into two arguments: `load file` took the head as a BFD target and
loaded the tail, and `openfile write` truncated the redirect at the split, writing
the C to a file named after the first component. The CLI now quotes a path that
needs it, and the console's `read_filename` accepts a double-quoted argument
(`\"` and `\\` are escapes inside quotes; any other backslash is literal, so a
Windows path survives either spelling). Unquoted paths parse exactly as before.
Hand-written console scripts and interactive `decomp_dbg` sessions get the same
grammar — quote the path when it contains a space:

```
load file "/home/u/test dir/a.out"
openfile write "/tmp/out dir/main.c"
```

**`--language auto|c|rust`** selects the output language. **`auto` is the
default and follows the binary**: a Rust binary renders as Rust, because kuna
already detects one (`kuna-analysis`'s `sourcelang` pass, the port of Ghidra's
`SourceLanguageAnalyzer`) and rendering it as C is worse in a way the reader has
to undo by hand (DIV-80). Detection is high-precision, not heuristic; an
unreadable file leaves C in place; and `--language c` always wins, so the policy
can only ever add a language. It lowers to the upstream `option setlanguage`, so
`--option setlanguage rust-language` is equivalent; an unknown name is an error
rather than a silent fall back to C. `decompile-all --json` reports the resolved
choice in a top-level `"language"` key. The same recovered function is rendered
through a different profile — types, structuring and analysis are identical —
producing `unsafe fn n(mut a0: i64) -> u32`, `let mut v: T;` declarations, Rust
primitive spelling, `x as T` casts, `loop`/`while c {}`, and `match v { A | B =>
{ … } _ => {} }`. The contract is `syn::parse_file` validity, not `rustc`
compilation: the output calls functions that have no definition and does no type
checking. Constructs Rust cannot express — an unstructured `goto` the structurer
could not remove, a C switch fall-through — render as a comment plus a diverging
`panic!("kuna: …")` so a lossy site is never mistaken for a translation; grep
that marker to measure them, and `--option gotoreduce on --option taildup on
--option ifelseflatten on` to reduce them. `--language` also works on
`decompile-all`; `decompile-project` is C-only -- it never auto-selects, and errors on an
explicit non-C language -- and the Ghidra front-end pins its markup document to
C. The browser decompiler carries the same three choices in its **Language**
control. See `docs/spec/09-emission.md` §9.6.
Omitting `--mode` selects `auto`: files below 500 KiB use `aggressive`, files
from 500 KiB up to 2 MiB use `reliable`, and files at least 2 MiB use `fast`.
The raw on-disk byte length is used, with exact cutovers at 512,000 and
2,097,152 bytes. A later explicit `--option` wins over the resolved preset.
Address-selected single-function decompilation suppresses a preset-provided
`fast_funcdisc` whole-image walk because the requested entry is already known.
Name selection keeps it enabled so generated `sub_<addr>` names can resolve;
explicitly spelling `--option fast_funcdisc on` opts an address run back into
that analysis.

**Failure contract (DIV-45).** A function whose decompile pipeline aborts is
*loud*:

- **exit code `1`** — the same code as a run-level error (no such function, no
  architecture, no C at all). Exit `0` means the pipeline completed.
- **stderr** carries `error: decompilation failed for <fn> in <binary>:
  <reason>`, followed by `note: decomp_dbg stderr:` and the console's own
  stderr (the panic line and its source location), truncated at 2000 chars.
- **stdout still carries the recovered shell**, whose body comment names the
  same reason: `/* WARNING: decompilation failed: <reason> */`. A shell with
  the generic `/* WARNING: structured blocks unavailable (structuring
  declined) */` means the pipeline *ran* and produced no structured blocks —
  a different failure.

**Load and analysis failures (DIV-90).** `kuna decompile` runs the engine in a
subprocess, so it recovers *why* a run failed from the console transcript — and
reports it in the same words `decompile-all` / `functions` / `decompile-project`
use, so one failure reads identically from all four commands:

- **the binary could not be loaded** — `error: could not build an architecture
  for <binary>: <reason>` (e.g. `Non-global scope has empty name`, `No sleigh
  specification for x86:LE:64:default`, `not in recognized object file format`),
  exit `1`. The older `could not build an architecture for <binary>
  (unsupported/!recognized binary)` is now only the fallback for a transcript
  that carried no reason at all.
- **the analysis commit failed** — `error: read symbols (analysis commit)
  failed: <reason>`, exit `1`, **and no C**. The console keeps its session alive
  after a failed `read symbols`, so C *can* still be rendered, but from a program
  whose debug facts were applied only up to the failing step and cannot be
  re-committed; that C used to be printed with exit `0`, indistinguishable from a
  binary with no symbols at all. `--option datasyms off` (or naming whichever
  analysis pass is implicated) is the way to get a run through.

The abort itself is not fatal to the console session (`decomp_dbg` prints
`Skipping <fn>: <reason>` and keeps going, so datatest `<stringmatch>` rules
still evaluate); the CLI is what turns it into a non-zero exit.
`decompile-all` / `decompile-project` / the WASM front-end are unaffected: a
failed function stays a per-function `error` record and never aborts the batch
(its text now carries the real panic message instead of `panic with non-string
payload`).

## `kuna decompile-all` / `kuna functions` — whole binary, machine-readable

```bash
kuna functions ./a.out --summary --json                # where do I start?  (~1 KB)
kuna decompile-all ./a.out --json                      # every CODE-backed function
kuna decompile-all ./a.out --functions main,parse --json
kuna decompile-all ./module.o --addr .text+0x660 --json
kuna functions ./a.out --json                          # full callable-symbol inventory
kuna functions ./a.out --sort size --limit 10          # the ten biggest functions
kuna decompile-all ./a.out --reachable-from main --json    # only what main touches
kuna decompile-all ./a.out --functions main,parse --json
kuna decompile-all ./a.out --json                      # every CODE-backed function
```

The whole-binary surface (the benchmark + LLM path). Runs **in-process**
(`kuna_console::engine::bootstrap_from_object` → `commit_pending_analysis` → loop
`decompile_func` + `print_c`), loading + analyzing the binary **once** instead of
`kuna decompile`'s subprocess-per-function (≈10×+ faster on a many-function binary).

### Triage — narrowing the run

An unfiltered whole-binary answer is only usable if the caller can narrow it
*before* it is produced: a 211 KB PE crackme is 1,150 functions and **5.9 MB** of
`decompile-all --json`, which is more context than the question is worth. Both
surfaces therefore take the same selection flags, and they choose which entries
the run *has* — `decompile-all` decompiles only what survives them, so narrowing
is what makes the run cheap as well as small.

| Flag | Selects |
|---|---|
| `--filter REGEX` | functions whose name — or any alias — matches (unanchored [Rust `regex`](https://docs.rs/regex) syntax; `(?i)` for case-insensitive) |
| `--min-size N` / `--max-size N` | functions whose inventory `size` is within the inclusive bound |
| `--reachable-from <name\|0xaddr>` | the named function plus everything it reaches through the call graph |
| `--sort addr\|size\|name` | ordering — `addr` (default) ascending, `size` **largest first**, `name` ascending; every key breaks ties on the address, so a narrowed run is reproducible |
| `--limit N` | keep the first N after sorting |

Filters compose (they intersect), and a selection that matches nothing is an
answer, not a failure: it exits 0 with `count: 0`. The zero-discovery verdict
below stays attached to *discovery*, so it can never fire because a filter was
too narrow. `--filter` / `--min-size` / `--max-size` / `--limit` are pure
inventory arithmetic and cost nothing extra; `--reachable-from` additionally
walks the program once.

`--reachable-from` is the "what does the entry point actually touch" question,
answered with **`kuna xrefs`' own reference edges** (`kuna-analysis`'s
`listing::xrefs`) rather than a second call-graph model that could disagree with
them. A call, a tail jump, and an *address-taken function pointer* all count as
edges — the third one matters: on a glibc ELF `_start` reaches `main` only
through the pointer it hands `__libc_start_main`, and a callback registered with
`CreateThread` or `atexit` is likewise code the caller reaches. A materialized
address that does not land on a known function entry is a string or a global, not
a callee, and is not an edge. The operand resolves as a name first and only then
as bare hex, so a function genuinely called `abc` is never read as `0xabc`. A
name that resolves to nothing exits 1.

On the 211 KB PE above, pointing `--reachable-from` at the one function that
references the challenge prompt (found with `kuna xrefs --to` on the string) cuts
the run from 1,036 decompiled functions to 307 — **5,943,701 bytes / 11.5 s down
to 876,577 bytes / 2.5 s**, with the answer still inside it. Adding `--min-size
256 --sort size --limit 10` brings it to 115,667 bytes / 1.8 s.

### `kuna functions --summary` — orientation in one call

```bash
kuna functions ./crakersme.exe --summary --json    # 2,820 bytes
```

The first call to make on an unknown binary: it answers *where do I start*
without emitting a function list at all, let alone pseudocode.

```json
{"binary":"…","count":1150,"total":1150,"error":null,
 "summary":{"entry":{"name","address","address_hex"},
            "reachable_from_entry":334,"no_callers":714,"code_bytes":171971,
            "size_buckets":[{"bucket":"0","min_size":0,"max_size":0,"count":114}, …],
            "largest":[{name,address,address_hex,aliases,size}, …]}}
```

- `entry` is the **image's declared entry point** (a PE `AddressOfEntryPoint` is
  the CRT startup, not `main`), named with kuna's best name for it, or `null`
  when the format declares none.
- `reachable_from_entry` counts *discovered* functions the entry point reaches,
  and is `null` when there is no entry point or nothing was decoded at it (a
  packed image); `no_callers` counts *selected* functions that no CALL site
  references — the roots and the dead code. Both come from the same xref edges
  `--reachable-from` walks.
- `size_buckets` partitions the whole extent domain (`0`, `1-15`, `16-63`,
  `64-255`, `256-1023`, `1024-4095`, `4096+`), so nothing falls between buckets;
  `max_size` is `null` on the open-ended one.
- `largest` holds the `--limit` biggest functions, 10 by default.
- The triage flags apply: `--summary --reachable-from main` summarizes just that
  subgraph. `count` is what was selected, `total` what discovery found.

Without `--json` the same measurements print as tab-separated lines. `--summary`
is accepted on `decompile-all` too, where it short-circuits the decompile loop
entirely — asking where to start must never cost a whole-binary decompile. Both
surfaces load through the `functions` (inventory) driver bundle for it, so the
numbers a caller orients by are the ones `kuna functions` reports.

### The JSON documents

`--json` emits
`{binary,count,functions:[{name,address,address_hex,aliases,object_location,size,code,error,
line_mappings:[{line_number,addresses}],variables:[{name,type,kind,arg_index,
stack_offset,size,line_numbers,addresses}]}]}` (`kuna functions --json` emits
`name`/`address`/`address_hex`/`aliases`/`object_location`/`size` per function).
`object_location` is `null` for linked images and undefined imports; for a relocatable
definition it is `{section_index,section,offset,offset_hex}`. `count` is what the
`functions` array holds. `kuna functions --json` also carries `total`, the count
before any triage narrowing; `decompile-all --json` carries `total` only when a
triage flag actually narrowed it, so an unfiltered whole-binary document — the one
the decbench backend and `kuna decompile --json` read — is byte-identical to
before. `line_mappings` maps 1-based
lines in `code` to sorted, unique machine-instruction VMAs. Variable `line_numbers`
come from the printer's `varref` tokens; variable `addresses` are the union of the
mapped instruction addresses on those lines. Both are empty when no backed use is
emitted. The references are captured from Kuna's markup emitter and resolved against
the live p-code IR, rather than inferred from the rendered text. The ordinary
plain-text renderer still produces `code`, so its bytes are unchanged.
Reported variables are joined to native varrefs by ABI or stack storage and recovered
high-variable identity. Multiple high-variable fragments are combined only when they
name the same exact stack location and size; ambiguous name-only matches stay empty.

Per-function `size` is the entry's byte extent, and both surfaces report the same
number with the same meaning — it is an **inventory** fact, measured without
decompiling, so `kuna functions --json` alone is enough to rank a binary's functions
by weight (the "decompile the three biggest functions" first move costs one call, not
a whole-binary run). It is an **upper bound**: the address-contiguous clip from the
entry to the next entry, or to the end of the containing CODE section, whichever comes
first — so inter-function alignment padding is counted in. Against ELF `st_size` over
the 1428 symbolized-fixture functions with ground truth it is never short, exact for
231, and overshoots by a median of 8 bytes (worst 52). An entry in no CODE section — an
import pointer slot, an undefined external — reports `0`, as does a function whose
extent could not be measured. A caller needing the exact body must still decompile.

Per-function `code` matches `kuna decompile ... --option listing on` byte-for-byte on
x86-64 (elsewhere, see the injected defaults below), `error` isolates a single failed
function, and `variables` (params in ABI order + DWARF/stack locals) feed type-recovery
scoring. `--no-vars` leaves `variables` empty but still emits function line mappings.

Behaviors specific to `decompile-all`:

- **Executable default targets** — an unfiltered run decompiles canonical entries
  contained by loader sections marked `CODE`. Callable import pointer slots in PE
  IATs, Mach-O symbol-pointer sections, and similar data areas remain in `kuna
  functions`, remain installed for named calls and prototypes, and remain
  reachable through explicit `--addr`; they are not automatically decoded as
  function bodies. Analysis-discovered entries inside executable sections join
  this default set. A name that identifies entries at several addresses is rejected as
  ambiguous instead of selecting the first. Loaders without section metadata retain the
  complete inventory.

- **Relocatable-object selectors** — an `ET_REL`/`.obj` is loaded into a synthetic VMA
  space, but its original coordinates remain available. `--addr` accepts a synthetic
  `0xVMA`, `.section+0xOFFSET`, or `SECTION_INDEX:0xOFFSET`. A bare numeric address keeps
  backward compatibility: a mapped synthetic VMA wins; otherwise it resolves a defined
  function at that raw section offset only when unique. Ambiguities list every candidate
  with its section, raw offset, synthetic VMA, and symbol binding. Arbitrary unmapped
  addresses are errors. Only symbols marked undefined/import by the object are reported as
  external.

- **Relocation diagnostics** — supported relocations are applied before decoding. Entries
  that cannot be applied are grouped by architecture, relocation type, and failure reason,
  with exact totals, at most eight groups, and at most three samples per group. A public load
  emits that report at most once; successful loads are silent. Diagnostics remain on stderr,
  so JSON on stdout stays valid, and the fixed group/sample limits keep stderr bounded even
  for objects containing thousands of identical failures.

- **One record per function entry** — a whole-binary run reports (and decompiles) each
  entry address exactly once. A function can carry several names: a `.symtab` symbol
  plus a debug-info one (`macho_dwarf.o` has `_l0` and `first_byte` at `0x0`), a
  decorated/undecorated PE pair, or the generated `sub_<addr>` placeholder an analysis
  pass registers over an already-named entry. `name` reports the most informative of
  them — a real symbol beats a synthesized `_INIT_<i>`/`_FINI_<i>`/`_DT_INIT`/`_DT_FINI`
  table name, which beats a generated `sub_`/`func_`/`FUN_`/`LAB_` placeholder; ties
  prefer the unprefixed spelling (`main` over `_main`), then the shorter name — and
  `aliases` carries the rest (`[]` when there is only one). `--functions <name>` matches
  aliases too, so any name that used to select a function still does. On ARM the Thumb
  mode bit is folded out of symbol addresses, so a function whose ELF `st_value` is odd
  (`compute` at `0x100b9`) is reported once, at its real even entry — and `--addr` accepts
  either spelling, resolving an odd ARM address to the entry it belongs to instead of
  decompiling mid-instruction. The fold is ARM-only: an odd address on a byte-aligned ISA
  is a genuine entry and is left alone.

- **Injected default options**: under the concrete `reliable` preset it injects
  `option listing on` unless the caller names
  `listing` (DIV-15), so the default-on `noreturn_propagate` call-graph fixpoint fires and
  a stripped binary's unnamed exit/fatal wrappers no longer swallow the functions after
  them; on non-x86-64 binaries it likewise injects `funcstart_patterns on` and `aif on`
  unless the caller names them (see `docs/history.md`). `--option listing off` opts
  out. Single-function `kuna decompile` injects the Listing the same way, and
  reaches for the **discovery half on a second attempt**: a by-name selection that
  the console answers with `no function matches` is retried once with
  `funcstart_patterns on` + `aif on` on a non-x86-64 image, so a name that exists
  only because discovery generated it -- the `sub_<addr>` `kuna functions` and
  `kuna strings` print -- selects the same entry those surfaces report. Nothing
  that already resolved changes: the first attempt is the script it has always
  been, and the retry is skipped for `--addr`, for an ambiguous selector, and for
  a load or pipeline failure. The bundle is not injected up front because it
  changes the entry set and not every entry it adds is real -- on i386 and PPC64
  the prologue matcher seeds a start a few bytes inside a function it already
  knew (PPC64 ELFv2's local entry point), and `funcboundflow` then truncates the
  outer function at that seed. That trade is the whole-binary surfaces' to make,
  where the wider inventory is the point; a single-function request that already
  named its function gains nothing from it. (The gap was invisible under the
  default `auto` policy below 500 KiB, which resolves to `aggressive` and names
  all three options itself.)
  `kuna functions` shares the **discovery** half of that policy (DIV-68): on a
  non-x86-64 binary it injects `funcstart_patterns on`, `aif on`, and the
  `listing on` those two are gated behind, so the inventory always contains every
  entry `decompile-all` would decompile (stripped betaflight STM32F405 under
  `--mode reliable`: 1 entry listed before, 5,798 after, against the 5,797
  `decompile-all` decompiles). That costs a whole-program decode there — 0.08 s to
  5.27 s on that firmware — which is the price of a correct answer. On x86-64
  `kuna functions` injects nothing and is unchanged: the Listing is measured
  entry-neutral on that architecture, so it stays the decompiling surfaces'
  default. The interactive console keeps the engine default off; an auto-selected
  `aggressive` preset names all three itself, on either surface.
  Omitted `--mode` first resolves the size-based `auto` policy. `--mode fast`
  names and disables the three exhaustive program-wide decode/discovery options
  (`listing`, `funcstart_patterns`, `aif`), suppressing those injections, and
  enables `fast_funcdisc`. That bounded pass recursively promotes direct CALL
  targets from loader-backed roots and adds conservatively validated
  pointer-table targets, so a stripped project does not collapse to imports plus
  its entry point. An explicit `--addr` selector suppresses the preset-provided
  pass because the entry is already known; `--functions` keeps discovery active
  so generated names can resolve. Explicitly spelling `--option fast_funcdisc
  on` opts an address run back in. A later explicit `--option` always wins.
- **Per-function watchdog** — `--max-fn-seconds N` (`0` disables): an
  unfiltered `decompile-all`/`decompile-project` run in the resolved `fast`
  preset defaults to 10 seconds per function. On native, selected-function runs
  and the other presets retain 120 seconds; an explicit value always wins. WASM
  arms only the fast whole-binary 10-second policy and leaves its other commands
  unbudgeted. A function whose decompile drive exceeds the budget is cut off
  cooperatively (deadline probes at the action/rule-pool/heritage loop
  boundaries) and recorded as that function's `error` (`"per-function
  decompile budget exceeded (N s)"`), the batch continuing. This is not a hard
  process timer: it does not bound discovery, unprobed decoder work, C/variable
  rendering, artifact construction, total export time, or memory. Driver
  policy, not a stage-model settable — zero output change for a function whose
  drive completes before expiry; the console / `decomp_dbg` parity path never
  arms it.

The decbench backend (`decbench/decompilers/raw/kuna_raw.py`) shells out to
`kuna decompile-all --json`.

## `kuna xrefs` — cross-references

```bash
kuna xrefs ./a.out --to authenticate            # who references this?
kuna xrefs ./a.out --to 0x1030 --json           # by address, machine-readable
kuna xrefs ./a.out --from main                  # what does this reference?
kuna xrefs ./a.out --from main --kind call      # call sites only
```

The navigation query: `--to` returns everything that references the target — call
sites, branches, and data references — and `--from` returns what the target
references: its callees, the functions it tail-jumps to, and the data it touches.
The two directions and the per-row `kind` mirror the DecLib CLI's
`xref_to`/`xref_from`, so an agent that knows one knows this.

The target is a **symbol name or an address** (`0x`-prefixed, or bare hex). A name
is always resolved as a symbol first, so a function really called `abc` is not
silently read as `0xabc`. Function names, the `s_<addr>` string symbols the
`strings` pass installs, and named data globals all resolve — which is what makes
the string-to-its-users hop work: `kuna xrefs ./a.out --to s_400915`. A function
name that identifies several entries — two same-named locals in a relocatable
object — is reported as ambiguous with every candidate, never answered for
whichever one the symbol table holds first.

| `kind` | What it is |
|---|---|
| `call` | A direct CALL to the target (a call site). |
| `jump` | A direct branch to it: a tail call, a PLT thunk. Intra-function branches are control flow, not references, and are omitted from `--from`. |
| `data` | The target's address is materialized as a value — address-taken: a function pointer, a string pointer, a global's address. Also the value of a **literal pool** word an instruction loads (`ldr r0,[0x86e4]` where 0x86e4 holds the string's address), which is how an ARM literal gets an owning function at all; the pool word itself is a separate `read` row from the same instruction. Only pointer-sized reads of *non-writable* memory are followed. |
| `read` | The target is loaded from. |
| `write` | The target is stored to. |

### One import, two addresses

An imported function has two addresses and the import's name is on both: the
**IAT/GOT slot** the loader fills in, and the **forwarding veneer**
(`jmp qword ptr [slot]`) a direct `call` can target. `kuna functions --filter
VirtualProtect` on a MinGW PE therefore answers with two entries — a veneer at
`0x1400079b0` and a slot at `0x14000d234` — and which of the two a given call
site references is a compiler decision, not something the question was about.

`--to` is answered over both: the veneer, the slot it jumps through, and any
other veneer through that same slot are one **alias class**, and the answer is
the same whichever member is asked for. The class comes from the decoded
forwarding jump, never from a shared name, so two unrelated functions that happen
to be called `init` are never folded together. The veneer's own `jmp [slot]` is
excluded from the answer — it is the other half of the callable, not a caller of
it. `target.aliases` lists the other members (empty for everything that is not an
import, which is nearly everything), and every row still carries the real
`to_address` it landed on, so an agent can see whether a call site went through
the veneer or straight through the slot.

```
# 2 references to VirtualProtect @ 0x1400079b0
# same import at 0x14000d234 (VirtualProtect) - a forwarding veneer and the pointer slot it jumps through
0x140001a9e	read	__write_memory.part.0+0x18e	CALL qword ptr [0x14000d234]
0x140001cce	read	_pei386_runtime_relocator+0x19e	MOV R12,qword ptr [0x14000d234]
```

Flags: `--json`, `--kind call,jump,data,read,write` (repeatable-by-comma filter),
plus the shared `--mode`, `--option N V`, `--slice`, `--target`, `--sleighpath`.

`--json` emits

```json
{"binary": "...", "direction": "to", "count": N,
 "target": {"name","address","address_hex",
            "aliases": [{"name","address","address_hex"}]},
 "xrefs": [{"address","address_hex","kind",
            "from_address","from_address_hex","to_address","to_address_hex",
            "from_function": {"name","address","address_hex"},
            "to_function":   {"name","address","address_hex"},
            "instruction": "CALL 0x1030"}]}
```

Both ends of every edge are always spelled out, so a consumer never has to infer
which one `address` meant; `address` itself is the end the query did not already
name (the referencing site for `--to`, the referenced location for `--from`).
`from_function` / `to_function` are `null` when nothing owns that address — a
`.rodata` string has no containing function. Without `--json` the output is a `#`
header line naming the query followed by one tab-separated row per reference.

```
# 1 reference to __cxa_finalize @ 0x1030
0x1102	call	_FINI_0+0x22	CALL 0x1030
```

This is a query, not an engine change: it loads the binary once through the same
in-process seam `decompile-all` uses (`bootstrap_from_object` →
`commit_pending_analysis`), then reads the references out of the p-code the SLEIGH
lifter already emits for every discovered function
(`kuna-analysis/src/listing/xrefs.rs`). It commits nothing into the engine and
changes no emitted C. Function discovery is the `kuna functions` inventory, which
the walk then extends by following the call graph out of it, so a callee the
inventory missed is still covered.

`--mode` is **not** resolved through `auto` here, unlike the decompiling surfaces:
`auto` selects `aggressive` under 500 KiB, and `aggressive` is a preset for the
quality of emitted *C*. Two of the passes it turns on cost a whole extra decode of
the program apiece and answer nothing a reference query reads — the analysis-tier
Listing walk (whose recursive descent `xrefs` repeats itself over the same bytes)
and `operand_refs` (whose scalar markup `xrefs` recomputes from the p-code it
already has). So the query surface defaults to the shipped defaults, and
`kuna xrefs --mode aggressive` still asks for the full analysis bundle explicitly.
On a 466 KB obfuscated i386 image the two skipped decodes were 1.08 s and 0.58 s of
a 3.4 s answer that is byte-identical without them.

Dropping the Listing does **not** drop the discovery it fed. The query surface takes
the same DIV-20/DIV-68 discovery flags every other surface does (`funcstart_patterns`,
`aif`); it just consumes them itself, from its own decode:

* the `<patternpairs>` prologue starts go straight into the walk's seed set;
* the speculative gap-walk (`aif`) runs over the partition the walk leaves behind,
  and the functions it accepts are walked like any other, so their references join
  the answer. Without it, a function reached only through a function-pointer table
  is in no seed set and `--to` loses every call site inside it — measured on a
  stripped i386 PE as 61 of one function's 174 callers.

The address you ask about is itself a seed. A recursive descent answers for the code
it can reach, and an entry with no inbound CALL edge is not reachable from any seed
set, so `kuna xrefs --from <that entry>` used to answer `count: 0` about a function
that plainly has references. It is now walked last, after the seeded descent has
drained, so it can only add coverage — an address the walk already decoded is
attributed exactly as before, and an address that does not decode is not recorded as
a function at all.

A target nothing references is exit `0` with `count: 0` — an answer, not a
failure. A name that resolves to nothing is exit `1` with the reason on stderr; a
malformed command line is exit `2` with the usage block.

## `kuna disassemble` / `kuna read` — instructions or bytes, when the pseudocode is not enough

```bash
kuna disassemble ./a.out main                    # a function, whole extent
kuna disassemble ./a.out main --json             # machine-readable
kuna disassemble ./stripped.bin 0x8049850 --addr # a raw address
kuna disassemble ./a.out 0x1140-0x11a0           # an explicit range
kuna disassemble ./a.out 0x2010 --addr --bytes 64  # bytes no function owns
kuna read ./a.out 0x100003f30 --addr --bytes 96  # a hexdump of a data address
kuna disassemble ./packed.bin 0x2010 --addr --as code   # decode data as code anyway
```

The floor to fall back to when the ceiling gives way. Every RE agent that asked
for this had already tried decompiling: a function with no recovered body, a
dispatcher emitted as `switch(0)`, an indirect call through a stack buffer the
program decrypts at runtime. When the pseudocode cannot answer, the instructions
still can — and until now the only way to see one was to leave kuna for
`objdump`.

The target is a **name**, an **address**, or a **range**:

| Target | What is listed |
|---|---|
| `main` | The function's extent — the same clip `kuna functions` reports as `size`. A name is resolved as a symbol first, so a function really called `abc` is never read as `0xabc`. |
| `0x8049850` (`--addr` for bare hex) | That function's extent if the address is a discovered entry; otherwise 64 bytes from exactly there. |
| `0x1140-0x11a0`, `0x1140..0x11a0` | Exactly that half-open span — the direct replacement for `objdump -d --start-address=.. --stop-address=..`. |

`--count N` stops after N listed entries and `--bytes N` after N bytes; either
overrides the derived extent, and a listing stops at whichever limit it reaches
first. Also accepted: `--as`, `--json`, plus the shared `--mode`, `--option N V`,
`--slice`, `--target`, `--sleighpath`.

```
$ kuna disassemble ./fauxware main --count 9
# 9 instructions at main @ 0x40071d (0x40071d..0x40073e, 33 bytes)
0x40071d      55                    PUSH RBP
0x40071e      4889e5                MOV RBP,RSP
0x400721      4883ec40              SUB RSP,0x40
0x400725      897dcc                MOV dword ptr [RBP + -0x34],EDI
0x400728      488975c0              MOV qword ptr [RBP + -0x40],RSI
0x40072c      c645f800              MOV byte ptr [RBP + -0x8],0x0
0x400730      c645e800              MOV byte ptr [RBP + -0x18],0x0
0x400734      bf15094000            MOV EDI,0x400915
0x400739      e8d2fdffff            CALL 0x400510
```

Address, raw bytes, instruction. The instruction text carries exactly **one**
space between mnemonic and operands — the same spelling `kuna xrefs` puts in its
`instruction` field, so one `grep 'CALL 0x400510'` matches both surfaces and the
JSON. `--json` emits

```json
{"binary": "...", "kind": "code", "target": {"name","address","address_hex"},
 "start": N, "start_hex": "0x..", "end": N, "end_hex": "0x..",
 "count": N, "bytes": N, "truncated": false, "notes": [],
 "instructions": [{"address","address_hex","size","bytes","mnemonic","operands","text"}]}
```

`bytes` on a row is that instruction's own bytes as contiguous lowercase hex
(`"4889e5"`); `end` is one past the last instruction actually listed, so a
truncated listing hands back the address to resume from. `kind` is `"code"` here
and `"data"` in the byte view below.

Bytes the translator will not decode are listed in place as `.byte 0x<nn>` rows,
one byte each, and the walk continues — a listing that ran into inline data says
so where it happened instead of stopping silently.

### The byte view

An instruction listing is the wrong answer for a data address, and for a while it
was the only one on offer. An agent that asked kuna for the encoded globals at
`0x100003f30` got `ADD byte ptr [RCX],AL` / `OR CL,byte ptr [RBX]` — a correct
decode of `00 01 02 03 ..` and a lie about the program — and left for `xxd`.

So the target picks its own rendering, and `--as` overrides it:

| `--as` | What is listed |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default for `disassemble`) | Instructions, unless the start address is in a section the loader marks as data and not as code (`.rdata`, `.rodata`, `__TEXT,__const`) — then bytes, with the reason on **stderr**. A discovered function entry is always code, wherever it was linked. |
| `code` | Instructions, whatever the section says. A packer puts real code in `.data`. |
| `data` (default for `kuna read`) | Bytes, whatever the section says. |

`kuna read` is the same command with `--as data` as its default — the spelling to
reach for when what you want is the bytes, not a view of them as instructions.

```
$ kuna read ./crackme 0x100003f30 --addr --bytes 96
# 96 bytes at 0x100003f30 (0x100003f30..0x100003f90)
0x100003f30   00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f  |................|
0x100003f40   10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10  |................|
0x100003f50   20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  |                |
0x100003f60   25 73 00 43 72 61 63 6b 6d 65 20 4c 65 76 65 6c  |%s.Crackme Level|
```

Sixteen bytes a row, space-separated, with the printable-ASCII gutter — `xxd -g1`
with kuna's own address column, so the two are diffable. `--json` replaces
`instructions` with the contiguous span and its rows:

```json
{"binary": "...", "kind": "data", "target": {...},
 "start": N, "start_hex": "0x..", "end": N, "end_hex": "0x..",
 "count": N, "bytes": N, "truncated": false, "notes": ["..."],
 "hex": "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f",
 "rows": [{"address","address_hex","size","bytes","ascii"}]}
```

`hex` is the whole span in one piece and `rows[].bytes` is that same string cut
into sixteens — use either, never both. `count` is the number of listed entries
in both views (instructions, or hexdump rows); `bytes` is the span. A byte view
honors the requested end exactly, where an instruction listing overshoots to the
end of the instruction that straddles it. `notes` carries anything the command
would have said on stderr, so a `--json` caller never has to read two streams.

A listing whose length nobody asked for is capped at 1024 instructions, flagged
`truncated` and marked in the header. The extent is only an upper bound — clipped
at the next discovered entry or the end of the CODE section — so where discovery
is thin one "function" can run to the end of `.text` (`main` in one unpacked
crackme clips to 19,106 instructions). An explicit `--count`, `--bytes` or range
is honored however long.

This is a query, not an engine change, and it reinvents nothing: the binary is
loaded once through the same in-process seam `decompile-all` uses
(`bootstrap_from_object` → `commit_pending_analysis`), and every row comes from
`Translate::print_assembly` — the seam the console's own `disassemble` command
(`IfcPrintdisasm`) and the `decompile-project` `.asm` export already print
through. Nothing is committed into the engine, nothing is decompiled, and no
emitted C changes. Verified against `objdump -d`: 19,368 instructions across four
binaries — a 32-bit x86 ELF, an x86-64 ELF, a stripped x86-64 PIE and an x86-64
PE — byte-identical at every address, with the same instruction boundaries.

Exit codes follow the house contract: a listing is `0`; an unresolvable name or
an address with nothing mapped behind it is `1` with the reason on stderr (on a
packed image, run `kuna unpack` first — the original addresses do not exist until
you do); a malformed command line is `2` with the usage block.

## `kuna strings` — the string inventory

```bash
kuna strings ./a.out                                  # every literal, with the functions that use it
kuna strings ./crackme.exe --json                     # machine-readable
kuna strings ./a.out --filter '(?i)password|flag'     # regex over the text
kuna strings ./crackme.exe --encoding utf16           # wide Windows literals
kuna strings ./a.out --section .rodata --min-length 8
```

The triage query: what text is in this binary, where does it live, and — the part
`strings(1)` cannot answer — **which function uses it**. Finding the prompt is
never the goal; opening the routine that prints it is, and that hop is one
command here because kuna already has both halves.

The rows are the analyzer tier's **existing** string detection, not a second
scanner: the ASCII inventory is the same `StringLiteralPass` scan
(`kuna-analysis/src/analyzers/strings/`, the port of Ghidra's `StringsAnalyzer`)
that runs at load and plants the `char[N]` literals `kuna decompile` prints, so a
row here is a string the decompiler also knows about, at the same address. The
reference columns come from the same index behind `kuna xrefs`
(`kuna-analysis/src/listing/xrefs.rs`). Nothing is committed into the engine and
no emitted C changes.

| Column | What |
|---|---|
| `address` / `address_hex` | The **virtual** address of the first character byte — not a file offset, so it pastes straight into `kuna decompile --addr` or `kuna xrefs --to`. |
| `text` | The literal, terminator excluded. TAB/CR/LF are escaped in the text surface so a row stays one line; `--json` carries them verbatim. |
| `length` | Visible characters (code units for a UTF-16 row). `byte_length` is what it occupies, terminator included. |
| `encoding` | `ascii` or `utf16` — which width found it. |
| `section` | The section it lives in, `null` on an image scanned by segment. |
| `xrefs_count` | How many references land anywhere in the literal's extent, so `lea rax,[fmt+4]` still counts as a use. |
| `functions` | The functions those references come from, `{name, address, address_hex}` each. |

### Flags

`--encoding ascii\|utf16\|all` (default `ascii`). `ascii` is the analyzer's own
1-byte width. **`utf16` is not a convenience** — a UTF-16LE literal read at 1-byte
width ends at the NUL after its first character, which is exactly why a wide
Windows API argument renders as `LoadLibraryW("n")` instead of `L"ntdll.dll"`. The
2-byte matcher mirrors the 1-byte one exactly (same character recognizer, same
require-NUL-end rule, same minimum), over units on even addresses. Scope is
UTF-16**LE** whose units are in the 1-byte charset — the Windows-API case; a
big-endian or non-Latin wide literal is not recovered.

`--min-length N` (default `5`, the analyzer's own `minStringLength`). An unflagged
run reports exactly the inventory the engine marked up.

`--filter REGEX` matches anywhere in the text. The flavor is
`. * + ? | () [] {n,m} ^ $`, the `\d \w \s` shorthands and their negations,
backslash escapes, and a leading `(?i)` for case-insensitive matching; groups are
always non-capturing. Anything outside that — a lookaround, `\b`, `\xNN` — is a
command-line error (exit `2`), never silently reinterpreted into a different
pattern. Backtracking is budgeted: a pathological
pattern reports those rows as non-matching with a warning on stderr rather than
hanging.

`--section NAME` restricts the scan to one section; the leading `.` is optional
(`--section rdata` finds `.rdata`). A section the image does not have is exit `1`
naming the ones it does.

`--no-xrefs` skips the reference walk — the expensive half, since it loads and
lifts the program. Rows still carry text, address, and section; `xrefs_count` is
`0` and `functions` empty.

Plus the shared `--json`, `--mode`, `--option N V`, `--slice`, `--target`,
`--sleighpath`.

### Output

```
# 8 strings in ./SCORPiON.exe (ascii, min length 5, scanned by sections)
0x416030	ascii	15	.data	1	sub_401160	Correct serial!
0x41605c	ascii	16	.data	1	sub_401160	E24546F5F6B39F59
0x41613c	ascii	14	.data	1	sub_401350	%[^-]-%[^-]-%s
```

A `#` header naming the query, then one tab-separated row per string: address,
encoding, length, section, reference count, referencing functions, text. Text is
last because it is the only unbounded column.

```json
{"binary": "...", "encoding": "ascii", "min_length": 5,
 "filter": null, "section": null, "scanned": "sections", "xrefs": true, "count": N,
 "strings": [{"address","address_hex","text","length","byte_length","encoding",
              "section","xrefs_count",
              "functions": [{"name","address","address_hex"}]}]}
```

### What it deliberately does not report

The scan covers the **loaded and initialized** address set — the allocated,
file-backed sections, which is Ghidra's `getLoadedAndInitializedAddressSet` — and
takes only NUL-terminated runs. So `.strtab`/`.symtab` symbol names and
unterminated printable runs, which `strings(1)` prints by the thousand, are
absent: those are not program strings, and the ones that name something are
already in `kuna functions`. That narrowing is why the output is a few hundred
rows instead of a hundred thousand.

An image with no usable section table — a UPX-packed ELF keeps its program
headers and nothing else — falls back to its `PT_LOAD` segments, and the
`scanned` field says which set was walked (`sections` or `segments`). On a packed
image the answer is the packer's own data; unpack first and ask again:

```bash
kuna unpack ./packed -o ./unpacked && kuna strings ./unpacked --filter '(?i)flag'
```

A binary with no strings is exit `0` with `count: 0` — an answer, not a failure.
An unreadable or unparseable binary, or an unknown `--section`, is exit `1` with
the reason on stderr; a malformed command line is exit `2` with the usage block.

## `kuna unpack` — statically unpack a UPX-packed executable

```bash
kuna unpack ./packed                                   # writes ./packed.unpacked
kuna unpack ./packed -o snake.bin --json
```

The first move on a packed binary, and the only one that helps: every other kuna
surface is honestly useless on one. A UPX-packed file contains a loader stub and a
compressed blob, so `kuna functions` finds nothing, and decompiling the entry point
gives you the decompressor. `kuna unpack` reconstructs the original image so the rest
of the CLI has a program to work on — on the witness that filed this gap, `kuna
functions` goes from `count: 0` to 70, `main` included.

It runs **in-process**, with no external tooling: `upx -d` cannot be assumed present
wherever a release `kuna` runs, and handing a hostile binary to a packer to look at it
is not a thing an analyzer should do. The UCL NRV2B / NRV2D / NRV2E decompressors and
the branch-target filters are reimplemented in `kuna-analysis/src/upx/`.

Default output is `<binary>.unpacked`, overwritten if it exists (the name is
unambiguously this command's own artifact, and a command that fails its second
invocation is worse than one that rewrites its own output). `--json` emits
`{binary,output,packer,loader_version,format,format_name,method,method_name,level,
filter,filter_hex,pack_header_offset,pack_header_offset_hex,packed_size,
compressed_size,unpacked_size,count,blocks:[{offset,offset_hex,u_len,c_len,method,
method_name,filter,filter_hex,stored}]}`, where `count` is the number of compressed
blocks consumed.

**Coverage, and the failure contract.** Implemented: the ELF formats, methods 2–10
(NRV2B/NRV2D/NRV2E in their `_LE32`, `_LE16` and `_8` bit layouts) and the x86
`cto`/`ctoj`/`ctok` and ARM/AArch64 branch filters. Everything else — LZMA (method
14), the non-ELF targets, a packed shared library, the pre-12 loader block layout, the
`ctojr`/PowerPC/RISC-V/delta filters — exits `1` with the thing it cannot do **named**,
and writes no file:

```text
error: ./x: unsupported UPX image: compression method 14 (LZMA)
error: ./x: unsupported UPX image: unimplemented UPX filter 0x80 (ctojr32: …)
error: ./x: no UPX PackHeader found
```

That asymmetry is deliberate. A wrong unpacked binary is far more expensive than no
output at all: an unreversed filter leaves every call target in the file pointing
somewhere wrong while every size still adds up, the ELF still parses, and a reader has
no way to tell. So a run either produces the original file or refuses. Success is not
assumed from "it decoded" either — the walk requires the block stream to end on the
`UPX!` marker adjacent to the PackHeader, to total exactly the original file size, and
to reproduce **both** of the packer's own Adler-32 checksums (a flipped literal byte
decodes to a wrong image of exactly the right length; only the checksum catches it).

## `kuna decompile-project` — recompile-oriented project export

```bash
kuna decompile-project ./a.out                         # writes ./a.out.kuna/
kuna decompile-project ./a.out -o proj --functions main,parse
```

The project-export face of the same in-process core
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_project.rs`, a thin wrapper over the shared
`kuna_console::project` module — the decompile loop + artifact builders also behind the
web UI's Download-Binary-Source zip and `kuna_wasm project`). Identical
load-once/decompile-many path and flags —
`--functions`/`--addr`/`--max-fn-seconds`/`--mode`/`--option`/`--slice`/`--target`/
`--sleighpath`; no `--json`. Omitted mode is the same size-based `auto` policy
as the other file front-ends. In particular, a project input at least 2 MiB
automatically suppresses the exhaustive Listing consumers, prologue scan, and
AIF gap walk through the `fast` preset, while substituting rooted direct-call
and bounded pointer-table discovery. Its unfiltered per-function watchdog also
defaults to 10 seconds instead of 120; `--max-fn-seconds` overrides it,
including `0` to disable. Explicit `--addr` selections remain exact and
suppress that whole-image walk by default; named selections keep it so
generated names can resolve. Explicit `--option fast_funcdisc on` can restore
its program facts for an address-selected run, but does not add definitions
outside the selection.

Writes a project folder — default `<binary-filename>.kuna/` next to the binary,
`-o/--output DIR` overrides — of four artifacts designed so a human or LLM can study the
binary and attempt recompilation:

- `<name>.c` — every decompiled function, address-ordered, under
  `// Function: <name> @ <addr>` headers, failures as comments, `#include "<name>.h"`.
  One definition per loader- or analysis-discovered executable entry address:
  the export shares
  `decompile-all`'s CODE-backed target policy and one-record-per-entry
  enumeration above, so data import slots are not rendered as functions and a
  function carrying several names cannot produce several identical definitions.
- `<name>.h` — include guard + a generated recompile prelude (core scalar and
  `undefined`-family typedefs), the recovered user-defined type definitions, and one
  prototype per decompiled function, token-identical to the `.c` definition line.
- `<name>.asm` — labeled linear disassembly of every CODE section: labels match the `.c`
  function names, per-function `; arg:`/`; stack:` comments map decompiled variables to
  storage, undecodable bytes as `db` lines, and a `; --- data ---` tail labeling named
  globals plus every `dat_<hex>` the `.c` references, with raw bytes.
- `README.md` — size, arch id, entry point, function counts, sections table, file
  inventory.

The artifact format is purely additive and has no exporter-specific transform
(spec §9.7); the set of emitted definitions follows the selected P1 discovery
options, including `fast_funcdisc`.

## `kuna decompile-graph` — the whole program as one JSON graph

```bash
kuna decompile-graph ./a.out                           # to stdout
kuna decompile-graph ./a.out -o graph.json --label v3  # to a file
kuna decompile-graph ./a.out --functions main,parse    # every node, two bodies
```

One document holding every discovered function — its recovered signature,
parameters, C body and assembly — plus the call edges between them
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_graph.rs`). The same in-process
load-once path and the same flags as `decompile-project`
(`--functions`/`--addr`/`--max-fn-seconds`/`--mode`/`--define-function`/
`--option`/`--slice`/`--target`/`--sleighpath`; no `--json`, the document always
is), plus `-o/--output FILE` and `--label TEXT`, which is copied verbatim into
`binary.label` for a consumer that wants to stamp the document with its own
version. Written to stdout when `-o` is absent; with `-o` the file is the only
output.

**The document is C.** `codeC` names its language, so this surface refuses any
other — `--language rust` (or `--option setlanguage rust-language`) is an error
rather than Rust in a field called `codeC`, and the auto policy that follows a
rustc-built binary is off here for the same reason it is off for
`decompile-project`. Use `kuna decompile` or `decompile-all --json` for the other
output languages.

**`address` is the key, not `name`.** A name repeats inside one document
whenever several addresses stand for one callable: a PLT thunk and the import
slot it forwards through are both `printf`, and a Mach-O image carries the two
plus its stub. A consumer keying rows or edges by name will collide.

**Every discovered function is a node.** `--functions`/`--addr` narrow which
nodes get a decompiled *body*, not which appear — so `--functions main` buys the
whole call graph plus one body, at the price of one decompile. The bodies an
unfiltered run renders are exactly the ones `decompile-all` renders (the
CODE-backed target policy above); an address outside that policy is a labelled
row with no body even when `--addr` names it explicitly, and the run says so on
stderr.

**Both ends of every edge are rows of the same document.** Edges are the
`kuna xrefs` reference edges, walked through the same call-graph model
`--reachable-from` uses, and they carry that command's `kind` vocabulary: a
reference into the middle of a body resolves to the body, and one landing in no
discovered function (a `CALL 0x0` off a nulled relocation, a branch into a gap,
a materialized address that is a string) is not a call-graph edge and is not
emitted. Two runs of one command are byte-identical.

### The JSON document

```
{schemaVersion: 4,
 binary: {name,label,sourcePath,analysisImageBase,functionCount,edgeCount},
 functions: [{address,name,size,kind,parameters:[{ordinal,name,type}],signature,
              assembly,codeC,error,hasIndirectCalls,forwardsTo,isEntryPoint}],
 edges: [{callerAddress,calleeAddress,kind,calleeOrder}]}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | `4`. Bumped whenever a field is added, removed or changes meaning. |
| `binary.label` | The `--label` string, `""` when not given. Never interpreted. |
| `binary.analysisImageBase` | The PE optional-header ImageBase, else the lowest non-empty loadable segment VMA — the same static VMA space as every address below. `null` for a relocatable object, which has no static base. |
| `address` / `size` | The inventory entry and its byte extent, the same two numbers with the same meanings `kuna functions` reports. `address` is the document's only unique key — see above. |
| `kind` | `normal` a body of its own; `thunk` a body that only forwards (a PLT/stub-section entry, an imported name, or a lone jump); `import` a pointer slot the program calls through (a PE `.idata` entry, a Mach-O `__got`/stub slot); `data` any other named address that is not code (a Mach header symbol, an Objective-C class object); `external` a loader-defined undefined symbol with no bytes here at all. The last three are the rows with no body: this surface never decompiles an address that is not executable content, not even one `--addr` names. |
| `parameters` | The recovered parameters in ABI order. Empty for a row with no body. |
| `signature` | The `.h`-style prototype line, without the trailing `;`. `null` for a row with no body. |
| `assembly` | The function's instruction listing, one `<vma>  <MNEMONIC operands>` per line — the `kuna disassemble` walk, so an undecodable byte inside the body is a `.byte 0x..` row rather than the end of the listing. Present whenever a body was attempted, including when the decompile failed: the listing is what is left to look at. |
| `codeC` | The decompiled body, byte-identical to this function's `decompile-all --json` `code`. |
| `error` | Why this function has no `codeC`, when the decompile was attempted and failed. `null` with a `null` `codeC` means no body was attempted: a bodyless `kind`, or a `--functions`/`--addr` narrowing that did not select it. |
| `hasIndirectCalls` | The body contains a computed call (`CALLIND`), which files no edge because it has no static target. An indirect *branch* is not one — see `forwardsTo`. The call site is attributed to the row that contains it, the same rule that decides which function `kuna xrefs --from` lists an instruction under. |
| `forwardsTo` | Where a forwarding entry sends control: the destination of a direct lone jump, or the fixed pointer slot an indirect one reads. The slot half needs the jump to name it as a decode-time constant, which an x86 `jmp [rip+disp]` stub does and an AArch64 `adrp`/`ldr`/`br x16` stub does not — a Mach-O `__stubs` entry is therefore `kind` `thunk` with a `null` `forwardsTo`, and the import slot it reaches is a row of its own found by name. `null` for anything that does not forward. |
| `isEntryPoint` | This row is the image's declared entry point, resolved through the inventory so an ARM `e_entry` carrying the Thumb mode bit still lands on it. A format that declares no entry point marks no row. |
| `edges[].kind` | The `kuna xrefs` kind, so the two surfaces cannot disagree: `call` a direct call; `jump` a tail call or a branch into a neighbouring entry; `data` an address handed to something else to call — the edge that gives `main` a caller, since `_start` passes it to `__libc_start_main` as a pointer rather than calling it. A caller that both calls and mentions one callee gets one edge carrying the strongest of the two. |
| `edges[].calleeOrder` | Contiguous and zero-based per caller, in first-reference order, deduplicated on the callee. |

Rows are entry-VMA ordered, and each caller's edges follow that caller's order.
A field the program cannot supply is `null`, never a placeholder; a field that
could never be supplied is not carried at all, which is why there is no
module-qualified callee — the loader retains no library-module mapping.

## `kuna docs` — the manual, inside the binary

```bash
kuna docs                 # the topics, one per line, with a one-line summary
kuna docs cli             # print one of them
kuna docs --json          # [{topic, title, summary, bytes}]
kuna docs --all           # everything, concatenated, for piping into a context window
```

Every document is embedded at compile time with `include_str!`, so a release binary carries
its own manual and needs no checkout, no network and no `--sleighpath`. That is the point:
an agent handed only the binary can still discover the option catalog and the JSON schemas
it needs to drive it.

| Topic | Source | Why an agent wants it |
|---|---|---|
| `cli` | `docs/cli.md` | every subcommand, flag, exit code and JSON schema |
| `options` | `docs/options.md` | the generated option catalog with the symptom index — bad output → the flip that fixes it |
| `agents` | `docs/agents.md` | the repo rulebook and the doc map |
| `phases` | `docs/phases.md` | the P0–P9 model, for reasoning about *which* decision to flip |
| `modes` | `docs/modes.md` | the `--mode` presets and the size thresholds `auto` selects on |

`docs/options.md` is generated (`kuna catalog --markdown > docs/options.md`) and dominates
the embedded bytes at ~281 KB. A test asserts the embedded copy is byte-identical to the file
on disk, so a rebuild cannot ship a stale catalog — the same hazard
`kuna-decomp/tests/options_md_fresh.rs` guards for the file itself.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `2` unknown topic (the message lists the valid ones).

## `kuna catalog` — option discovery (the LLM control API)

```bash
kuna catalog --json              # the flippable assertion list, for an agent
kuna catalog --markdown          # regenerate docs/options.md
kuna catalog --check             # fail on catalog/registration drift (CI)
kuna catalog --tier transform    # filter to the transform-tier control surface
```

Parses the decompiler's `phase catalog` JSON (single source of truth: `settableTable`,
generated from `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/phases.toml`) into the documented, flippable
assertion list. `--markdown` output is tier-grouped and symptom-indexed; `--check`
cross-checks the catalog against `kuna_decomp::options::KUNA_OPTION_NAMES` in-process.
The rendered catalog is `docs/options.md`; the model behind it is `docs/phases.md` /
`docs/spec/`; the defaults are recorded in `docs/history.md`.

## `kuna specs` — the SLEIGH compiler

```bash
kuna specs -a specs/             # compile every .slaspec under a dir (slacomp's -a mode)
kuna specs <file.slaspec>        # compile one
```

A thin alias for `slacomp` (same CLI as upstream's `sleigh_opt`).

## Everything else

`kuna modes` (list the option presets) and `kuna fid` (function identification) also
exist, plus minor flags not covered here (`--no-vars`, `--raw`, `--regions`, `--timeout`,
…) — see the usage block in `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/main.rs`.
